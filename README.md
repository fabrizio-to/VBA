Introducing the CAMWorks Automation VBA UserForm!

I'm not a programmer, I was helped by AI.

This VBA UserForm is designed to facilitate the management of CAMWorks operation setups and post-processing within SolidWorks. It features:

Dynamic selection of operation setups and milling operations through intuitive lists

Phase tracking with a labeled combo box to specify production phases (Ph1 to Ph9)

Seamless post-processing of selected setups, generating accurate CNC files with phase suffixes

Automated file management, including output folder verification and safe base filename extraction

Robust error handling with user-friendly messages for smooth workflow

Convenient buttons for quick folder access and operation renaming

Visual feedback on operation statuses (active/suppressed) and tool assignments

This tool serves as a powerful interface that integrates directly with the CAMWorks API to automate setup handling and file generation, boosting efficiency and user experience.
